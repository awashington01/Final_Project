The plot above shows the running path of a boy. I defined x to be the integers from 1 to 10 and y to have the same numbers, in decreasing order. I then plotted the points, connected by a dotted line, and labeled the axes accordingly.

A 100 x 100 plot where the x-axis represented distance east, and the y-axis represented that of north. Using the sample() function, 10 dwellings were randomly selected. These points were stored in a data frame and labeled. Randomly placed trees were also plotted. Using a spline, I connected 3 of the 10 dwellings to show a path between the points.

This was a similar set up to the previous exercise, creating a 1000 x 1000 plot with 50 randomly plotted dwellings just increasing the amount of trees and the size of each plotted point to account for the increase in magnitude of data shown. There are 7 plots randomly selected to create a longer, spline path.
