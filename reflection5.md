  In today's world, the recording of data and information is everything. It is clear that the use of gathering large sums of data is important and affects our everyday lives. The 
increase of data science usage has caused an upsurge in our economy and has changed the way we live. But, with this increase comes concern about how safe it is to live our  lives 
knowing that all of our movements and transactions are being tracked and used for big data. This is where the argument brews that not all data is supposed to be obtainable. With 
the two sides trying to find a balance, there is still the fact that the use of data science has brought us significant gains in what we are able to achieve. Data science has many 
obstacles ahead but it also has a bright future that can make our lives better.

  The ongoing evolution of data science has already brought us to a better understanding of things like our economic system. For example, millions of people are invested in the 
stock market. These stocks fluctuate daily, making it difficult to really predict what will happen . With the collection of data over the years,  we can now identify that certain 
patterns in the stock market can be indicators on what might occur in the future. It can go even further, like in our lab with the predictor stocks. In that lab we used 5 stocks 
and made a correlation between each stock to see if they had any indicators that would allow us to predict what the other stocks would do. The ability to get insights like this 
allows us to continue evolving our economy because we will have a deeper understanding. 

  Also, data science has allowed us to analyze and predict human development processes. Everyone was taught in school about evolution and Darwinism, but we as a species are still 
evolving and we know this through the use of data science. Now by evolving I don’t mean growing an extra arm, but if you look back 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago,  to now you 
can see a difference in our interactions and our behaviors. As we have grown in intelligence, we built technological advancements that allowed us to essentially work less. With 
the decreased demand in physical labor we are left with more pleasure time. With the data that is collected, data scientists can predict human behavior. These predictions aid us 
to have a broader understanding of what is happening. Data science really does give us a better, “understanding of the entire universe around us.” (Geoff West in Scale, 2018). 

  Although there are many positives with this rapid growth in data science, there are still many negatives with how the gathering of data is conducted. For example, the usage of 
social media has grown exponentially. Everyone from grandparents to school aged kids are on social media. In all of the applications there are terms and conditions that most 
people will never read that basically allows the app to have all of their information and to track them. One of the more recent incidents with this was the application TikTok. 
TikTok went viral for its For You page and its algorithm behind it. People thought that no company should be able to do what TikTok was doing and that they took tracking people to 
another level. President Trump was ready to ban the application because so many Americans were on the app and their information was essentially compromised. This is why there must 
be a balance between gathering data and invading people’s privacy.

  In conclusion, the growth of data science has brought many insights to how we live or lives and how our economy works. It also has allowed us to take a look into what is to come. 
The challenge now is to continue this positive relationship with data science without crossing certain lines that will invade user privacy. When this balance is met, I believe 
that many beautiful things can happen to further our knowledge and enhance our way of living even further.
