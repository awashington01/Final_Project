For my third data science reflection, I am going to be discussing the use of machine learning in social media today. These days, machine learning is always discussed in the 
context of valuable user data insights retrieval. But this isn’t the best way to keep users as customers. Getting to know users by learning their tastes and interests is a proven 
key to having customer loyalty. This leads to all kinds of benefits like a high number of sales and increased brand awareness. We are exploring ways machine learning is used in 
all kinds of social media, both by media owners and third-party companies who search for customer insights.

Social media monitoring is the process of exploring and analyzing what has been said about a company and its product or service on the internet.Back in the day when social 
networking wasn’t as widespread as it is now, brands were able to keep up with users online by simply scrolling their feed and checking tags and comments. But as people developed 
a habit of posting on their socials daily, the amount of data multiplied at such a rapid scale that it became impossible to process manually. Luckily, the introduction of 
effective machine learning techniques for data processing gave the automation level needed. With automated machine learning powered solutions for social media monitoring brands 
finally get access to actionable insights to manage their brand image effectively and find out users’ feedback timely. 

The way that this works follows a structure. Machine Learning-powered networks analyze text, images, audio, and video files found on social media detecting mention of a brand 
being it a logo on a photo, a typed-in name, or a pronounced name in the video. That network is usually a part of a ready-made or custom social media monitoring platform. This is 
saying that brands can track social media activities from brand name mentions, to keywords perception. Most platforms provide the options of automatic reports, timely reminders of 
new or unusual activity on the web, and safe data storage as well. The fact that social media monitoring has become surrounded by a corresponding software, proves that brands 
highly rely on it as a part of their everyday operations.

Now that companies can retrieve all of this data effectively, this information can be used for marketing. Social media marketing is the use of social networks to promote a brand, 
its product or service. Even though it technically remains a part of digital marketing, the growth of social media resources makes researchers and practitioners separate it into a 
standalone discipline. The key goals of digital marketers are personalization, analytics, optimization, and brand awareness. This can be taken to the next level quite easily by 
incorporating machine learning solutions into the company’s operations. Machine Learning allows brands to drastically scale personalization, regardless of the sphere, product or 
service. Now, websites and apps can choose what content to display depending on the user’s behavior and interests, and even location. Also, benefits like optimized advertising, 
automated marketing campaigns, smart content creation, augmented analytics, automated content alteration, and effective PPC campaigns are only possible if a brand achieves a high 
level of marketing personalization for their customers. From the technical side, most Machine Learning applications for social media marketing highly rely on such AI subfields as 
natural language processing and optical character recognition.
